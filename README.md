This repo is a copy of the tutorial found [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cdktf-install)

Use terraform version 0.12, since with terraform version 0.13 and Up we need to import the docker provider in the main.ts file.
We may find this version [here](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/).

use cdktf latest version.

```
$ cdktf get
```

```
$ cdktf deploy
```

It just works fine with the version 0.12.

Now we may use the terraform version 0.14 and repeat the steps of deploying.

We got an error like the [following](https://gist.github.com/lVlario0O0o/b0d528d646319052326ada38cb510f6d).

Then we may  
* comment the line 3  
* uncomment the line 4 and 10  

to include the required provider in the cdktf.out/cdk.tf.json file generated by the cdktf-cli.

Remove the terraform.tfstate file and retry with the ``` $ cdktf deploy ``` command to make it work with the version 0.14.

For more information relate to this section of the terraform [upgrade guide to version 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html#explicit-provider-source-locations)
