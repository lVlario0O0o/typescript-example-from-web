This repo is a copy of the tutorial found [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cdktf-install)

use terraform version 0.12, since with terraform version 0.13 and Up we need to import the docker provider in the main.ts file.
we may find this version [here](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/)

use cdktf latest version

```
$ cdktf get
```

```
$ cdktf deploy
```

It just works fine with the version 0.12

Now we may use the terraform version 0.14 and repeat the steps of deploying.

We got an error like the [following](https://gist.github.com/lVlario0O0o/b0d528d646319052326ada38cb510f6d)
